# URL Shortening Service

Welcome to the URL Shortening Service, a project designed to provide a simple and efficient way to shorten long URLs. This service offers secure and reliable URL shortening while managing user sessions, storing data flexibly with MongoDB, and sending personalized email notifications.

## Project Overview

This project is built using Django for the backend and MongoDB for data storage. It provides a secure platform for shortening URLs and managing user interactions through cookies, session management, and personalized email notifications. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **URL Shortening:** Converts long URLs into shorter, easily shareable links.
- **Flexible Data Storage:** Utilizes MongoDB to store original and shortened URLs, leveraging Django's ORM for efficient data retrieval and management.
- **Session Management & Security:** User sessions are secured with cookies, and environment variables are used to protect sensitive information.
- **URL Validation:** Ensures that submitted URLs are properly validated before shortening.
- **Email Notifications:** Django's email functionality is used to send personalized emails with the shortened URLs to users for secure communication.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Django
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Email Service:** Django Email System
- **Session Management:** Cookies
